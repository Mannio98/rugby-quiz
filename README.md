## Testing

  I tested the website on different screen sizes. Because max-width had been declared in percentage media queries were not necessary and all screen sizes worked.
  
  I tested the quiz on three different browsers Chrome, Firefox and Edge and it worked on all of them.

  I confirmed that the quiz results are always correct.

  I confirmed that the font of the header, body and footer were all legible.

  I confirmed that the website's performance, accesibility, best practices ans SEO were all acceptable by running the website through lighthouse and got full marks for all categories.
